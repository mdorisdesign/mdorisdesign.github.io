					<p class="drop-down-paragraph"> In 2016, I began working for Blockhouse Furniture Company as their Webmaster. Before the end of the year, I  completely redesigned and developed a new website. The new site greatly enhanced SEO through stronger keywords and by providing a more enjoyable user experience. I used HMTL, CSS, CSS3, HMTL5, JavaScript, jQuery, and PHP languages during development.</p>

							<p class="drop-down-paragraph"> The original product page featured dated images with chairs covered in fabric. If the user didn't like the fabric on the chair, they wouldn't click on the product to view more details. The page was also very long and it was easy to lose orientation. The new page featured neutral colored fabric chairs to not bias the user. There was also a side navigation put into place to allow the user to easily get to each section quickly. This was done using a jquery smooth scroll. Each picture also became enlarged on hover indicating the user could click the product image to see more details.</p>

						`<p class="drop-down-paragraph">Shown above is the Fabrics page I dreamed up for Blockhouse. Customers would have to call in and request several fabric swatches based on a catalog they would receive from our sales representatives. This process was long and cumbersome. With the help of our IT department, I created a dynamically driven, interactive, fabrics page that would allow users to find the perfect fabric for their environment. This page was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. </p>

						<p class="drop-down-paragraph">The other idea I had brainstormed for Blockhouse was an interactive contact page. The phone number used to be listed at the top of the header but that was the only way a user could get in contact with the company. The page I created allowed the user to select their state and then send a message to their sales rep directly. A picture and bio of the sales rep would also appear after they selected the state. Creating a more personal connection with the person they would be speaking to. The basic contact information was also listed below. </p>

								SOLO is a super simple safety app that allows you to take on all of life's adventures with ease. I served as the User Experience Designer for the SOLO. I would love to show full details on this portfolio of the product but, SOLO is still being developed. In order to protect the User Interface Design of the App, I will only be reflecting on my role as the UX Lead. I would love to speak with you more in person in regards to the UI design!

					<!-- paragraph about image -->
							<p class="drop-down-paragraph"> 
								SOLO was my senior capstone project. During capstone, you are placed into groups and have until the end of the year to brainstorm an idea for a product, create a working prototype, and launch a Kickstarter. My group and I realized quickly that while we were very different individuals we all had one thing in common - fear. Our lives were changing quickly as seniors. We would be embarking on new adventures by ourselves. With kidnappings and murders on the news daily, we all admitted to being scared. So we began to brainstorm ideas of how to combat this fear.

						</figure> 
					<!-- paragraph about image -->
							<p class="drop-down-paragraph"> 
								We came up with the idea of creating an app that would alert a trusted user if you would not return from a specified event at the desired time. It was essentially collecting your missing person's report.<br><br> We loved the idea and new it could help people but how could we get people to want to use such a scary thing? By making it fun and inviting. I conducted extensive research on color and the competitive market. From that research, we were able to create this logo. The compass in the middle makes it exciting and adventurous rather than scary and ominous. The colors are warm, energizing, and appeal to both genders. They can also be seen by color-blind users.

					<!-- paragraph about image -->
							<p class="drop-down-paragraph"> 
								The first round of usability testing was conducted using a "POP" prototype. We used the "Time-To-Task" method and the "Think-Out-Loud" process to discover any major areas of difficulty. The heuristic evaluation we chose to implement was the "Error Correction" heuristic. This rule of thumb states in order for the device to be able to be usable there should be little to no errors, or there should be some way to prevent the error from happening.
								<br><br>
								The usability test revealed that SOLO is an aesthetically pleasing and usable application. The users were able to maneuver through each task with ease. No user faced extreme frustration while completing each task and was able to do so in a matter of seconds. Each of them commented on the overall pleasing design and both genders were attracted to the brand colors.
								<br><br>
								Overall, the app accomplished the goal of providing them with a sense of security.

							<p class="drop-down-paragraph"> 
								The usability testing had gone well and the feedback was wonderful! However, that wasn't enough to satisfy me that this app could appeal to everyone. I decided to conduct a focus group in order to truly find out. The faces above have been blurred to protect their identities. 
								<br><br>
								Utilizing the environment around us, we created several focus groups based on the most common social groups of our college: female athletes, female college students, substance-free female college students, male athletes, male college students, substance-free male college students. We asked users to signup for the group that they identified with best. 
								<br><br>
								We asked the groups open-ended questions about safety. We did not want to bias them about the idea of the app, we only wanted to learn about what situations make them feel in danger. The results were amazing! Almost every group reported the same findings. At the end, we showed them brief images of the app and asked their feedback. Everyone enjoyed the imagery and colors.

						</figure> 
					<!-- paragraph about image -->
							<p class="drop-down-paragraph"> 
							    Our group seemed invincible but we had one major thing against us, we were all iPhone users. This app needed to be programmed for iOS and Android devices. Therefore, we had to make sure the UI would be easy to understand no matter what medium it was on. 
								<br><br>
								 We conducted Split AB testing on several designs. We would design the same page in two different ways and ask users to perform a task on each. We would then ask for their feedback. This allowed us to understand what was the normal interactions and UI for each device.

							<img id="#drunk-goggle-tests" src="assets/drunk-gogle.png" width="100%" alt="Error of Opportunity Test">
						</figure> 
					<!-- paragraph about image -->
							<p class="drop-down-paragraph"> 
								One thing we understood right away, was the possibility of users operating the app while drunk. We had to be sure that the app was still just as easy to use while intoxicated. Of course, we couldn't ask testers to become drunk, that would be unethical. We could, however, ask them to wear "Drunk Goggles" and complete each task we ask of them.
								<br><br>
								During these tests, we used the "Error of Opportunity" method. Each screen of the app was analyzed to see how many possible areas of error there were on the screen. We then multiplied this number by the number of participants. We then tested and wrote down how many errors each individual participant made while proceeding to complete the task. We took the number of errors they made individually and divided it by the "Error of Opportunity" to get the success matrix. 
								<br><br>
								During testing, we also had someone write down exactly what errors were made. We later reviewed these notes and categorized the errors into slips, mistakes, user interface problems, or scenario problems. We were pleased to discover the app was still easy to use, even while impaired. While some areas had high error rates, it was due to slips and mistakes from the goggle's not the UI..

							<p class="drop-down-paragraph"> 
								The objective of the app was to release a Kickstarter campaign. After creating a video for the campaign, we used Experience Sampling to determine what areas of the video did not engage the audience's interest. During selected points of the video, users were asked to rate their experience on a Likert scale of 1-5. 1 being incredibly unenjoyable and 5 being highly enjoyable. No scores were below 4.

						<p class="drop-down-paragraph">The zoo was something I saw as being fun for teens. Something unique and edgy with vibrant neon colors. I didn't want to lose this across any part of the design process. I mad the business cards dark and "mysterious" to reflect that vibe.</p>

					<!-- paragraph about above image -->
						<p class="drop-down-paragraph">The Mental Health Association of Lebanon, PA came to LVC in desperate need of help. Their brand was actually turning people off. They felt it was much to clinical and the bell in their logo had a nasty stigma attached to it. Getting help for mental health disorders can be hard. They wanted people to feel invited to do so. I developed this brand for them.</p>

					</figure>
					<!-- paragraph about above image -->
						<p class="drop-down-paragraph">Lebanon PA is my home town. I've always loved living there too. When I think of Lebanon, I think of biking around town as I often did growing up. I think of rolling cornfields and small-town shops. I think of some of the historic landmarks and the friendly faces I'm used to seeing. I wanted to bring that small town nostalgic vibe to the brand.

					<!-- paragraph about above image -->
						<p class="drop-down-paragraph">I ended up going with the above color palette to create a brighter and warmer feel. I was hoping this would make someone feel empowered to seek out mental help. This is an example of what a pamphlet could look like for the MHA using my brand concept.</p>

						<p class="drop-down-paragraph">While I loved the logo, I realized it wasn't as flexible as my designs usually are. I created these logo variations to assist with responsive projects that require something much smaller. Overall, I was very pleased with how the project turned out.</p>
